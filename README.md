### About me:
- 👋 Hi, I’m @dadezz
- 👀 I’m interested in IT, economics, astrophysics, cybersecurity, mountaineering
  * I aim to develop broad, horizontal skills across multiple disciplines, rather than specializing deeply in just one.
- :books: I’m currently learning IT at University of Venice, I attended astronomy courses at the University of Padua
- :briefcase: [RBF-Morph](https://www.rbf-morph.com)
